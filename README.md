A quadruped robot control system developed during my sophomore year, utilizing LiDAR for positioning and implementing position control and VMC control for movement regulation.
## file introduction
`catkin_ws` is the main workspace, containing the source code of the robot.It will run with LiDAR to locate the robot's position.
`new` contains only the code controling the robot to move.
## notice
When I upload the code,I opened it with windows,so the file .so will be wrong,please delete it and get the .so file from Unitree's website and Linux's floder
